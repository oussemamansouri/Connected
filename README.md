# Connected
I'm thrilled to present the culmination of my hard work and dedication â€“ the presentation of my latest project, "Connected"! 

Connected is more than just a platform; it's a bridge connecting training centers with eager learners across Tunisia. Leveraging Angular, node.js (Express.js & Sequelize), and a SQL database, I've crafted an intuitive platform that facilitates seamless interaction between learners and educational institutions.

But that's not all! In my pursuit of mastering various backend technologies and enhancing my educational journey, I've created an alternative version of the platform utilizing Express.js, Node.js, and Sequelize ORM. This endeavor not only enriches my skill set but also underscores my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
